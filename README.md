### 📱 Navigation
- BottomNav component with four routes:

### 🔗 Google Calendar Export

- After applying to an event, users can click **"Add to Google Calendar"**

  - Title
  - Date (single-day range)
  - Optional description
- Implemented via dynamic link with `window.open(...)`
- Only shown if the user has successfully applied to the event
- Reusable `<AddToGoogleCalendar />` component placed:
  - Inside `EventDetails.tsx`
  - Under calendar event list (optional)

### 📅 Calendar Integration

- Visual dots mark dates with relevant events
- Calendar auto-filters:
  - Users: see only events they've applied to
  - Managers: see all events for their shift
  - Developers: see all events
- Weekends styled in red, today and selected date are highlighted
- Points displayed using `.dot` indicator and `tileContent`
- Navigation buttons and month label styled manually for accessibility
- Upcoming event list appears under selected date

### 🗕 Events Feature
- `/events` displays only **active** events
- `/events/:eventId` shows full event info
- Role-based logic:
  - Users can apply if event is from their shift
  - Managers can delete events from their shift or if they created them
  - Admins can delete any event
- `/events/create`:
  - Admins can create events for any shift
  - Managers can only create events for their own shift
  - Title is user-defined

### 🎁 Donations Feature

- `/donations` — displays all **active** donation campaigns
- `/donations/:donationId` — shows full donation details:
  - Title, deadline, description, total collected, donor count
  - This info is visible to **all** roles (users, managers, developers)
- Donation status `hasDonated` is respected:
  - Users **cannot donate twice**
  - After donation, a thank-you message is shown ✅
- Users (`user`) can enter an amount and confirm their donation
- Managers and developers can delete donations they created (or any if admin)
- `/donations/create`:
  - Available to managers and developers
  - Inputs: title, deadline, optional description
- Users can donate **only once per donation**
- All data is processed through `camelcase-keys` interceptor and Axios

### 🎫 User Management Feature

- Unapproved users are now handled by managers and developers
- Backend route: `GET /api/admin/users/pending` returns all unapproved users
- Managers see only pending users from their own shift
- Developers see all pending users
- Each pending user card displays:
  - Name, Email, Shift, Role, Phone
  - “Approve” (✅ PATCH `/api/admin/users/:id/approve`)
  - “Delete” (🗑 DELETE `/api/users/:id`)
- Styled red border to highlight pending users (`.card.pending`)

### 🧑‍🦯 Accessibility (A11y) Improvements

The project now supports better accessibility for users with screen readers or other assistive technologies.

**What was implemented:**

- Replaced `alert()` messages with visually rendered text using `<p aria-live="...">` to provide non-intrusive, accessible feedback for success and error messages.
- Ensured that all interactive elements (like buttons) include `aria-label`s to describe their action clearly.
- Marked error and success messages with `aria-live="assertive"` or `aria-live="polite"` to ensure they are read by screen readers appropriately.

**Example changes:**
- Registration form now displays error and success messages inside the DOM instead of using `alert()`, which improves accessibility and user experience.

---

## 🔁 Data Normalization

### ✅ Now handled globally via Axios interceptor:

```ts
// api/axios.ts
api.interceptors.response.use((response) => {
  response.data = camelcaseKeys(response.data, { deep: true });
  return response;
});
```

- Installed [`camelcase-keys`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/camelcase-keys) to convert backend responses into frontend-friendly `camelCase` format.
- Used in:
  - `UserContext.tsx` during auto-login (`is_approved` → `isApproved`)
  - `Login.tsx` after manual login before saving to context

```bash
npm install camelcase-keys
```

- Ensures compatibility with TypeScript interfaces (e.g., `User`) and improves code consistency.

## 🔐 Authentication

- ✅ JWT token is saved to `sessionStorage` on login
- 🔐 Axios interceptor (in `api/axios.ts`) automatically attaches the token
- 🔁 `UserContext.tsx` attempts auto-auth on refresh using `/api/protected`
- 🧠 Normalized user profile is saved to context
- 🔁 On page refresh, auto-login is attempted if token exists
- 🔒 Errors (e.g. expired session) are caught with `AxiosError` and shown via `alert`
- 🔐 Manual logout clears token and resets context
- User profile updated via PATCH `/api/users/me`
