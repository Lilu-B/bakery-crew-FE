# üßÅ Bakery Crew Hub ‚Äî Frontend

A mobile-friendly web app for a private bakery team network, built in response to a community event management brief. This internal platform allows team members to view and apply for overtime events, contribute to holiday donations, and sync events with their Google Calendar.
Currently, communication is one-way: managers can create and broadcast events and donation campaigns to their assigned shift. While users cannot directly message managers yet, two-way messaging is planned as a future feature.

While the original brief focused on an open community, Bakery Crew Hub adapts this concept into a secure, role-based system for managing a real-life team‚Äôs workflow and participation in internal events.

## Test Accounts

You can use the following pre-approved accounts to explore the app:

```plaintext
Admin:
Email:    admin@bakery.local
Password: password123

Manager 1:
Email:    manager1@bakery.local
Password: user123

### User Management Feature

- Unapproved users are now handled by managers and developers

- Managers see only pending users from their own shift
- Developers see all pending users
- Each pending user card displays:
  - Name, Email, Shift, Role, Phone
  - ‚ÄúApprove‚Äù (PATCH `/api/admin/users/:id/approve`)
  - ‚ÄúDelete‚Äù (DELETE `/api/users/:id`)
- Styled red border to highlight pending users (`.card.pending`)

### Accessibility (A11y) Improvements

The project now supports better accessibility for users with screen readers or other assistive technologies.

**What was implemented:**

- Replaced `alert()` messages with visually rendered text using `<p aria-live="...">` to provide non-intrusive, accessible feedback for success and error messages.
- Ensured that all interactive elements (like buttons) include `aria-label`s to describe their action clearly.
- Marked error and success messages with `aria-live="assertive"` or `aria-live="polite"` to ensure they are read by screen readers appropriately.

**Example changes:**
- Registration form now displays error and success messages inside the DOM instead of using `alert()`, which improves accessibility and user experience.

---

## Data Normalization

### Now handled globally via Axios interceptor:

```ts
// api/axios.ts
api.interceptors.response.use((response) => {
  response.data = camelcaseKeys(response.data, { deep: true });
  return response;
});
```

- Installed [`camelcase-keys`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/camelcase-keys) to convert backend responses into frontend-friendly `camelCase` format.
- Used in:
  - `UserContext.tsx` during auto-login (`is_approved` ‚Üí `isApproved`)
  - `Login.tsx` after manual login before saving to context

```bash
npm install camelcase-keys
```

- Ensures compatibility with TypeScript interfaces (e.g., `User`) and improves code consistency.

## How to Run Locally

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Lilu-B/bch-FE.git
cd bch-FE

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Start the development server
npm run dev
```

App runs at:  
http://localhost:5173

---

## Authentication

- JWT token is saved to `sessionStorage` on login
- Axios interceptor (in `api/axios.ts`) automatically attaches the token
- `UserContext.tsx` attempts auto-auth on refresh using `/api/protected`
- Normalized user profile is saved to context
- On page refresh, auto-login is attempted if token exists
- Errors (e.g. expired session) are caught with `AxiosError` and shown via `alert`
- Manual logout clears token and resets context
- User profile updated via PATCH `/api/users/me`

---
